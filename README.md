# RISC-V Flight Computer
## Overview
We are using the VSD Squadron Mini which uses the 32-bit CH32V003F4U6 microcontroller based on RISC-V architecture as the Primary Flight Computer

## Features
- VSD Squadron Mini as the primary flight computer
- NRF24L01 PA+LNA for near range radio communication
- Arduino Nano as the communication interface between NRF24L01 PA+LNA and VSD Squadron Mini (Arduinon nRF doesn't support RISC-V boards a new library is in development)
